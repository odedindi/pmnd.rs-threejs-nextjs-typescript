# Next.js Three.js Example

This Next.js project showcasing THREE.js integration draws inspiration from an existing example found at [this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/cards-with-border-radius-9s2wd9?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js%3A10%2C1-10%2C65).
While the core concept remains, I've adapted the original JavaScript code into TypeScript and refactored it to enhance modularity through code splitting. By leveraging the flexibility of TypeScript and Next.js, the project provides a structured and efficient approach to incorporating THREE.js functionalities within a Next.js application.

## Features

- Demonstrates the integration of Three.js in a Next.js app router application.
- Extends geometry and material to create custom THREE elements with typescript support.
